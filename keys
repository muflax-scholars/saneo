LRUD (PU PD)?       	4+2	maybe modal setup + normal cursors works well enough?
Esc                 	1  	mostly useless, not a problem on normal-ish position
Del Ret Bck (Ins)   	3+1	del+bck could *maybe* be shift-merged, but otherwise both keys are really important... maybe put them on m3?
Tab                 	1  	could be worked around, maybe - only useful in ff and emacs, and there i have alternatives
ctrl (alt) for emacs	1+1	could be worked around? alt is mostly useless, and maybe some modal setup could eliminate *most* ctrl combos?
(win) for windows   	1  	is useful, but reachable enough, so not a problem
SPC                 	1

probably put shift on the side for the pinkies then :/

could push a few symbols on m3+shift, like m3: >, s3: »
so overall, all the m3s would fit ok-ish, and many would be in the same position

open problems:

ctrl in terminal (C-c, C-d, C-t, C-r)
this might be easiest to fix by making super_l into ctrl. i might rebind C-r, though, and look into more vim-y keys for zsh.
(and using a C-* thing for awesome?)

emacs modal key
m3-spc?


plan:

# - integrate the umlauts into m3
# - simplify and reorder the m3 layer a bit
- remove alt keys
- simplify win keys
- remove/simplify ctrl in firefox
- remove/simplify ctrl in terminal
- simplify m4

uncertain:

- remove m4
- modal layer in emacs
- flip the keyboard
- change m3 a bit more
