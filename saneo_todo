greek/cyrillic -> nah, should be an IME (not enough layers anyway)
multikey is stupid, might just use it (and the one above) as shortcuts for special IMEs, maybe cyrillic/greek?

completely unused: the number keys, except for numbers
mod4+shift is rarely used (and then only for compatibility stuff with the mod4 layer); mod3+mod4 is never used
