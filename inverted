	{ to improve
		- much better numbers, probably on the right mod4 block (diacritics can be emacs'd)
		- instead of "mod4-key + key" for a diacritic char, use "pseudo-compose-key + key" somewhere good-ish
		- somehow magically solve the navigation key problem, so I don't need a thumb all the time, maybe through nav-mode
