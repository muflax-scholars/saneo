muflax' custom keyboard layouts. Have a look at "mod3.txt" for a basic overview.

"saneo" is the xbd file you should use, but "saneo.xmodmap" generally works too if you're forced to use a machine without admin privileges. "neo.map" is a version for pure terminals. The additional files tend to be somewhat incomplete and out-of-date.

"euro.txt" is one way to (later) implement full diacritic support, based on ibus-table.
